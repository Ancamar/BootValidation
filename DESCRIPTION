Description: Main objective of a predictive model is to provide accurated predictions of a new observations. 
             Unfortunately we don't know how well the model performs. In addition, at the current era of omic
             data where p >> n, is not reasonable applying internal validation using data-splitting. Under this 
             background a good method to assessing model performance is applying internal bootstrap validation 
             (Harrell Jr, Frank E (2015) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4757-3462-1>.) This package provides bootstrap validation
             for the linear, logistic, multinomial and cox 'glmnet' models as well as lm and glm models.
